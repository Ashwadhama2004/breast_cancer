# Breast Cancer Detection Using Decision Tree

This project implements a machine learning model in Python to detect breast cancer using the Decision Tree algorithm. The model is trained on the `breast_cancer.csv` dataset, which contains features like tumor size, shape, and texture. The goal is to classify tumors as benign or malignant. To run the project, install the necessary libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`) and execute `train_model.py` to train the model. The results can be evaluated using accuracy metrics, and the decision tree can be visualized for interpretability. Contributions are welcome!
